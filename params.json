  "body": "# Abstract\r\nVisual identification of microorganism requires a lot of experience and expertise from a person, who performs identification / recognition, but still canâ€™t guarantee high level of accuracy. Modern high precision approaches (like DNA / special sites sequencing) are expensive and time consuming. <p>\r\nThis project has been designed to be an express tool for visual identification of microalgae cells on picture taken by microscope camera.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Problem description\r\n### Given:\r\nPicture of microalgae, made with microscope camera and contained several cells.\r\n### Find:\r\n- Belonging to specie / genera <br>\r\n- Probability of correct identification, measured in %\r\n</ul>\r\n<H3>Approach / Tool:</H3>\r\nPre-trained Neural Network (NN)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<H1>Possibilities </H1>\r\nRight now project is trained to identify following genera (without identifying specie name):\r\n<br> <ul>\r\n<li>Achnanthidium</li>\r\n<li>Aulacoseira</li>\r\n<li>Chlorella</li>\r\n<li>Craticula</li>\r\n<li>Cymbella</li>\r\n<li>Cymbopleura</li>\r\n<li>Desmodesmus</li>\r\n<li>Encyonema</li>\r\n<li>Encyonopsis</li>\r\n<li>Eunotia</li>\r\n<li>Fragilaria</li>\r\n<li>Frustulia</li>\r\n<li>Gomphonema</li>\r\n<li>Navicula</li>\r\n<li>Nitzschia</li>\r\n<li>Nupela</li>\r\n<li>Pinnularia</li>\r\n<li>Planothidium</li>\r\n<li>Psammothidium</li>\r\n<li>Sellaphora</li>\r\n<li>Stauroneis</li>\r\n<li>Surirella</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>Tolal : 22 genera\r\n***\r\n<H1>Further work</H1>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Add identification of multiple objects per photo</li>\r\n<li>Add highlighting and counting of identified objects</li>\r\n<li>Add creating of reports / Sending it via e-mail</li>\r\n<li>Improve recognition accuracy and variety of objects for recognition</li>\r\n<li>Add various recognition algorithms for pictures made with varied microscopes and magnifications</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n***\r\n\r\n<H1>Testing</H1>\r\nCurrent testing version is deployed on `c9.io`:\r\n<br>https://id-microalgae-pererva.c9users.io/\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Deploying and requirements\r\nProject has been tested on Windows 7 ... 10 (64-bit only) and Ubuntu 14.04 ... 16.04 (64-bit only) with Python 3.5.\r\n\r\n### Deploying on Windows:\r\nInstall Python 3.5.2 (other versions were not tested)\r\nhttps://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/\r\n\r\nCreate the folder for your project (let say D:\\MicroAlgae_ID)\r\nOpen it in explorer and run the command line from current location (click the right mouse button in explorer windows with pressed Shift-key and choose the Run Command Line here from pop-up menu).\r\nInstall the virtualenv for python (you can install other packages in system python, but it has conflicts in Windows 8-10, so using of virtual environments is strongly recommended) by running:\r\n<br>`pip install virtualenv`\r\n<br>Create the virtual environment:\r\n<br>`virtualenv -p python3 .\\`\r\n<br>Enter the created environment:\r\n<br>`.\\env\\Scripts\\activate.bat`\r\n<br>Install other required packages:\r\n<br>`pip install Django TensorFlow Pillow`\r\n<br>Copy the `src` and `tf` folders to your project folder (D:/MicroAlgae_ID) and type in opened command line:\r\n<br>`python .\\src\\manage.py runserver`\r\n<br> To create the one-click start for project create a `run.cmd` file in project folder with following content:\r\n<br>`call .\\env\\Scripts\\activate.bat` \r\n<br>`python .\\src\\manage.py runserver`\r\n\r\n### Deploying on Ubuntu:\r\n\r\nOpen the terminal and create the project folder (let say ~/ID_MicroAlgae):\r\n<br>`mkdir ~\\ID_MicroAlgae`\r\n<br> Install the virtualenv, create the environment and activate it:\r\n<br> `pip install virtualenv`\r\n<br> `virtuaenv -p \\usr\\bin\\python3 ~\\ID_MicroAlgae\\env`\r\n<br> `source ~\\ID_MicroAlgae\\env\\bin\\activate`\r\n<br> Install all requirements:\r\n<br> `pip install pillow django tensorflow`\r\n<br> Copy the `src` and `tf` folders to your project folder (~/ID_MicroAlgae) and type in opened command line:\r\n<br>`python ~\\ID_MicroAlgae\\src\\manage.py runserver`\r\n<br> Now You should have an access to project via browser by entering the address\r\n<br> `127.0.0.1:8080`\r\n<p>Sometimes (if you are deploying on some public free domains like `c9.oi` ) you could need to modify this command to something like (Please, check the documentation ):\r\n<br>`python ~\\ID_MicroAlgae\\src\\manage.py runserver $IP:$PORT`\r\n<p>\r\nTo create the one-click start for project create the run.sh file in convenient for you location with following content:\r\n<br> `source ~\\ID_MicroAlgae\\env\\bin\\activate && python ~\\ID_MicroAlgae\\src\\manage.py runserver`",
